PIPFIT - **p**rivacy **i**gnorant **p**ersonal **fi**nance **t**racker - is a tool
to track and manage bank accounts, credit cards, and more. Unlike existing platforms
like [Mint](www.mint.com), PIPFIT does not rely on screen scraping and does not require
you to enter your bank account login information!

Moreover, PIPFIT is completely open source.
